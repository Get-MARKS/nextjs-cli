# NextJS CLI
## _Tool for NextJS automation_
![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)

Created this tool to automate the file creation while creating components.

## Features
- Able to create component with css file
- more coming soon...

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [nodeJS] - For creating files

And of course NextJS CLI itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

NextJS CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
npx next-component-create "/path/to/component" "ComponentName"
```
